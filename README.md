# homelab-public
General homelab scripts, mostly bootstraps for installing and configuring various 
InfoSec and IT software on CentOS 7. 

These scripts were intentionally written in Bash to make it super easy for people
with limited Linux experience to run them without running into dependencies issues
or Python version issues. It's designed for homelab newbies to copy and paste or
download and directly run .sh files.

I've started migrating some of this to Ansible for more advanced users, and will
probably migrate some to Python too one day.

Some of the oldest scripts date back to when I worked at @ziften in 2011 and
have continued writing code while at @rapid7 .

I'm the primary contributor to @rapid7 's presales engineering GitHub repository
too: https://github.com/rapid7/presales-engineering/tree/tim-dev

Some of the scripts in this homelab repository are related to some of the Rapid7
scripts.
