# homelab-public
General homelab scripts, mostly bootstraps for installing and configuring various software on CentOS 7
I'm fully aware that Bash isn't the best option for a lot of these things, 
and that other languages like Python would be better suited for it.

The reason I wrote these files in Bash was to make it super easy for people with
limited Linux experience to run them
without running into dependencies issues or Python version issues.

A good amount of the code can be copied and pasted into the command line
by people less experienced with Linux.

This is kinda related to some files in https://github.com/rapid7/presales-engineering/tree/tim-dev
