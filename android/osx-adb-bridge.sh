fastboot erase system

# flash new Android version onto it - sent it to the phone

# Whole process takes about 5 minutes to start booting into Android OS
# boot device into Fastboot mode (not fastbootd) - do a fresh boot into the bootloader, don't do this after issuing other commands
# visit this page in CHROME: https://flash.android.com/release/12.0.0
# Click ADD DEVICE and pick the Pixel 3, it shouldn't already say "paired" next to it.
# it does a LOT of steps and reboots the phone several times automatically
# This tool only does Android versions that are OFFICIALLY supported by Google, so for example on the Pixel 3 it does Android 12, but does NOT support Android 13 for the Pixel 3
# late in the process you will have to touch buttons on the phone to approve locking the bootloader
